## API documentation

Before using the SSAP API for the first time, we strongly recommend that you learn the main concepts of the Sofia2 platform. They have been included in the Sofia2 developer documentation, which can be downloaded from http://sofia2.com/desarrollador_en.html.

## Build instructions

The Java API is distributed as a maven project. Its artifact can be built and installed in the local maven repository using the following commands:

```
cd <root of your copy of the repository>
mvn clean package [-Dmaven.test.skip]
mvn install:install-file -DpomFile=pom.xml -Dfile=target/ssap-standalone-<API version>.jar
```

During the compilation process, a "fat" JAR containing the API and its dependencies will also be generated. It will be placed in the path

```
<root of your copy of the repository>/target/ssap-standalone-with-deps-<API-version>.jar
```
